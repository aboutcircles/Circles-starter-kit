# Welcome to Circles Hacker Guide
This is Hacker Guide to support hackers/developers which can be utilized during hackathon and/or if someone is building on top of circles and wants to get a quick overview of how to utilize Circles SDK, reach out to team, etc.

Circles is a social currency initiative built on Gnosis Chain, designed to facilitate local and global economies through a regular token issuance and demurrage system. 

## ETH Accra'2024
At ETHAccra we are particularly interested in seeing projects that leverage our SDK to build with community, social and sybil resistance in mind.
Most Innovative Use Case of Circles:

**ðŸ¥‡ First Prize: $800**

**ðŸ¥ˆ Second Prize: $500**

**ðŸ¥‰ : Third Prize: $300**

## What can you build ?

### Community
Community is a core value to Circles, build an application that centres around community participation and engagement. Here are some examples:
- Events platform which utilizes Circles Avatar and allows folks to connect and trust
- Marketplace
  
### Social
Use the Circles SDK to build anything from social networks to SocialFi protocols. Circlesâ€™ decentralised trust model allows you to replicate your real world connections on-chain. Here are some examples ideas:
- Messaging app 
- Social graph analysis
- Gaming
  
### Identity/Sybil Resistance
Circles protocol allows for the verification of real people without the use of any intrusive third parties. We're looking for projects that advance identity solutions within the Circles ecosystem, ensuring secure and genuine social interactions. Here are some examples ideas:
- Reputation systems
- Decentralised identity verification
